# [JSL02] Submission: Debug the DOM


# Project Overview
- I was given a debugging task to prevent users from adding the same goal more than once. I had to enhance the user experience and prevent duplicates, so I implemented a check to ensure that the same goal cannot be added more than once. If a duplicate goal is detected, it should not be added to the list.

# Project Brief
- The goal was to prevent users from adding duplicate fitness goals to the list.
- I had to check if the goal being added already exists in the list before appending it.
- I had to  display an alert to inform the user if they try to add a duplicate goal.
- I focused on the code structure within the function and how to handle duplicates.

# Elements included 
- Code that includes modifications to prevent duplicate fitness goals from being added to the list.
- GitHub repository containing the updated code files.

# Reflections 

### Areas of mastery 
- There aren't any areas that I have mastered, and I feel as though there is a lot that I still need to grasp.

### Challenges faced 
With this project, one of the main challenges I faced was simply finding new ways to produce the desired result.

### Areas of Improvement 
An area of improvement that I would like to focus on, especially on future projects (which will require more), is finding better ways to write more elegant lines of code that reduce clutter and unnecessary lines of code.

## Overall learning experience
My overall experience was quite overwhelming as I was only beginning to understand the little intricacies of writing JavaScript code and all the vast ways to do it. The experience was not on the posistive side, even though I was able to figure out how to complete the brief.
